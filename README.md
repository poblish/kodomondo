kodomondo
=========

*Find your way in the World of Code, wherever you are in Chrome.*

**Kodomondo** is a Chrome extension that can subscribe to a range of different data sources, highlighting relevant terms within the web pages you visit, letting you explore the references in more detail.

Each datasource is configured with its own **keywords, stopwords, and contextual rules**, so that only the most relevant web pages are ever touched by the highlighter. The aim is to minimise noise, and provide only the most useful matches.
